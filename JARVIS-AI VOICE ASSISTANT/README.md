**JARVIS---AI-VOICE-ASSISTANT**-
Python-based offline AI voice assistant using local LLM (Phi) and NewsAPI

Jarvis is a Python-based AI voice assistant, similar to Alexa, built as a student project to understand how real voice assistants work by integrating AI, voice recognition, APIs, and system automation.

The assistant uses a free local AI model (Phi), making it offline-capable, privacy-friendly, and cost-free — perfect for learning and experimentation without paid APIs.

✨ Features

🗣️ Voice-controlled interaction with wake word “Jarvis”
🧠 AI-powered answers using locally integrated AI (Phi via Ollama)
🌐 Open websites like Google, YouTube, LinkedIn
🎵 Play music via predefined links
📰 Fetch and read live news headlines using NewsAPI
🔒 Works mostly offline (AI runs locally)
⚠️ Note: Since this project uses a free local AI model, responses may be slower than commercial assistants like Alexa, but it is fully functional and ideal for student use.
